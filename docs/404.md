# 404 (wtf!)

Documentation for this binary doesn't exist yet :(

Please help those that come here after you by [contributing to the documentation](https://github.com/lawndoc/winbin.wtf) when you figure out what this file is.
Or, at the very least, [make an issue](https://github.com/lawndoc/winbin.wtf/issues/new) including the folder path of the file you want added! Such as C:\Windows\System32\taskmgr.exe
