title: Windows File Documentation
---

## How to find a binary
This site is structured exactly like a C:\ drive on a normal Windows Desktop installation. To find documentation on the file you are looking for, just add its path to the end of this site's URL. For example, the documentation for calc.exe can be found at:

[`https://winbin.wtf/Windows/System32/calc.exe`](./Windows/System32/calc.exe)

If you can't find the page for the file you are looking for, then its documentation doesn't exist yet.

## Scope

The scope of this documentation is only files that come with a base install of any Windows Desktop version. This does not include opt-in binaries installed by the control panel item "Turn Windows features on or off." If/when all default Windows binaries are documented or this project receives more support, the scope of the documentation may expand.
